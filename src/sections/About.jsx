            Hi, I'm Suresh Jat, a passionate full-stack web developer and
            problem solver who loves turning ideas into real-world digital
            experiences. My journey started with a deep curiosity about how the
            web works, which led me to explore everything from data structures
            and algorithms to building full-stack applications using modern
            frameworks.
          </p>
          <p className="my-4">
            I'm currently focused on building clean, performant, and
            user-friendly web apps with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React,
            Node.js). Alongside that, I'm constantly improving my skills in
            authentication, real-time communication, and responsive UI
            development.
          </p>
          <p className="my-4">
            What truly drives me is the balance between logic and creativity ‚Äî
            whether I'm writing elegant backend logic or crafting pixel-perfect
            frontends. I enjoy collaborating, debugging complex issues, and
            learning new tools that can make development more efficient and
            enjoyable.
          </p>
          <p className="my-4">
            In addition to development, I'm deeply interested in solving
            algorithmic problems and have actively practiced DSA (Data
            Structures & Algorithms) through platforms like LeetCode. This helps
            me write optimized and scalable code.
